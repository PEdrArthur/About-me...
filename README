Hello, there!

Thank you for viewing this file. Once upon a time I created this account so I
would contribute to the ``1001 Algorithms to code before Die'' project.
However, some days after my first contribution to the project, I realize that
I already had an GitHub account by the PEdroArthur user name. Then, I'm using
this account, PEdroArthur, instead of PEdrArthur. Refer to the following link
to my actual account:

 - http://github.com/PEdroArthur

You may also find me in the following micro-blogs sites:
